Installation
------------

Before installing pygame, you must check that Python is installed
on your machine. To find out, open a command prompt (if you have
Windows) or a terminal (if you have MacOS or Linux) and type this:
::

   python --version


If a message such as "Python 3.8.10" appears, it means that Python
is correctly installed. If an error message appears, it means that
it is not installed yet. You must then go to the `official website
<https://www.pygame.org/docs/>`_ and follow the instructions.

Once Python is installed, you have to perform a final check: you have
to see if pip is installed. Generally, pip is pre-installed with
Python but we are never sure. Same as for Python, type the following
command:
::

   pip --version


If a message such as "pip 20.0.2 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip
(python 3.8)" appears, you are ready to install pygame! To install
it, enter this command:
::

   pip install pygame
